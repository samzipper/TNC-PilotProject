These groundwater basins are extracted based on an intersection between the raw Bulletin 118 groundwater basins 
and the WBDHU12_Navarro+Adjacent.shp file, which is the Navarro River Watershed + adjacent HUC12 watersheds.

Note that some of the basins extend beyond the boundaries because they are part of a unit which has a larger spatial extent with multiple shapefile.

The raw shapefile of basin boundaries is stored on GSAS and downloaded from https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-bulletin-118-groundwater-basins on 2018-11-20.
