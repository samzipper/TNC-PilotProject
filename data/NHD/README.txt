        WBDHU8_SouthForkEel+Adjacent.shp = South Fork Eel watershed + adjacent watersheds on all sides

        WBDHU12_SouthForkEel.shp = Sub-subwatersheds within South Fork Eel
    These are all extracted from the WBD_18_HU2_Shape dataset downloaded from ( ftp://rockyftp.cr.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Hydrography/WBD/HU2/Shape/ )
    which is stored on GSAS at ( Z:\2.active_projects\Zipper\1.Spatial_data\regional\SouthForkEel\ws_watersheds\1original )
