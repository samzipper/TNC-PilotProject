hybas_navarro files are basin shapefiles corresponding to the Navarro River,
extracted from the HydroBASINS dataset on 2018-01-11 by SCZ (manually).

Only levels in which the basin discretization changes are saved (e.g. level 08
is the same as level 07, and levels 10, 11, and 12 are the same as 09).
